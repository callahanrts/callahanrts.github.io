Chrome extension to interact with the Plug.dj API for auto-woot, auto-join, and download song.

Plug.dj is a social djing platform that allows multiple people to alternate playing songs. This
extension interacted with their API to add some automation. It would let you choose to auto-woot
songs, auto-join the queue to play a song, and download songs as mp3s when they're played. There
is a local application to accompany this that becomes the client for the mp3 download.
