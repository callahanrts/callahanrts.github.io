An Übersicht widget meant to replace the OS X titlebar when using a tiling window manager like kwm.

I've been experimenting with tiling window managers for OS X, speficially [kwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm).
I set the default OS X title bar to hide unless hovered and set some extra padding at the top of
the screen for my windows to make room for bar. Then I added back some basic battery, date, time,
and active window widgets, as well as a widget for displaying the song that is currently playing.
To add Youtube and Soundcloud support for the currently playing track. I created another chrome
extension that sends the current track name to the desktop where bar can pick it up.
