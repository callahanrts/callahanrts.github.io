Text editor plugin for interacting directly with slack. Send/receive messages from various
channels and team members in your Slack organization.

When our company moved to the Slack chat client, I thought it would be nice and save time to upload
code snippets directly from my text editor. The project quickly eveolved into a full fledged
Slack client accessible from within the Atom text editor.
