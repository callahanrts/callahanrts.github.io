Chrome extension for mixpanel that adds a button for exporting Mixpanel People results to a CSV.

One of our content people at work wanted to export Mixpanel People results to a CSV but there
wasn't a way of doing that currently. Our mixpanel contact sent her a python script that would
allow her to do the export. Since that was not particularly easy for her, I created a chrome
extension from an open source library I found on Github to do the job.
