Linux, but aspiring cross platform, successor to [bar]({% post_url 2016-01-22-bar %}) built on
electron. It can be configured in yaml to display some system status information.

I spent some time setting up an Archlinux desktop with i3wm just for the fun of it. Since i3wm
doesn't have a very nice status bar by default, I created my own. Element is easily configured
with yaml. You can create status bar widgets in coffeescript and style them with [less](http://lesscss.org/).
