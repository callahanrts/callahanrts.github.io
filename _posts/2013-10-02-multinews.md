News aggregator written in Go that allows you to store all of your favorite news
sources in a single location and easily switch between them.

It was also a great way for me to explore some new technologies and create something fun that interacted
with Hacker News and Reddit. I was inspired to create my own clone after seeing a handful of
Hacker News clients float through my feed.
