An iPhone application aimed at solving the problem of owning too many gift cards.
With Card Wallet, you can scan all gift cards that have bar codes or you can enter the data manually.
The application will then generate a bar code that can be used at the store. The end result is a
wallet that is not stuffed with gift cards.

I created CardWallet at the suggestion of a friend who had too many gift cards in her wallet and
wanted a mobile application to manage them all for her. Although it didn't make me an instant iOS
app success story, it was a fun project and was well worth my time to learn some new technologies
outside of the c++ projects I had been writing for school.
