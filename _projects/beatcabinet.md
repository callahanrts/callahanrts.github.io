As one of my largest projects, <a href="http://beatcabinet.com/listen">Beatcabinet</a> is a web
application for collecting and playing songs from youtube and soundcloud. It's a way to organize
playlists of songs from the web.

Unfortunately, Soundcloud changed their _undocumented_ API (oops! probably shouldn't have used that)
for pulling in tracks from their chart lists. I was a little burnt out at the time so I decided to
wait until they released an official API. This project is still on hold but I'm excited for the
day I finally get around to finishing it.

If you'd like to try it out, go to <a href="http://beatcabinet.com/listen">http://beatcabinet.com/listen</a>.
But, be advised that you'll get an infinite loading spinner because it's trying to get tracks from
Soundcloud. To test it out with music, search for Youtube videos from the search bar.
