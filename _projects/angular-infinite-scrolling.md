Directive for easily implementing infinite scroll in angular. It can be imported directly or
installed with bower.

To be honest, it was probably redundant to create this. There are a few other implementations out
there. At the time, the one I was using was unintuitive and had some issues with my specific
environment (I can't fully remember what the issue was). In any case, it was a fun excersize in
creating an angular directive as well as a bower module.
