A guide to setting up dokku using vagrant to create the server as a virtual machine. The
purpose was to show my colleagues how I set up an Amazon EC2 instance as a personal Heroku.

I recently read about dokku in a Hacker News article and wanted to use it to host all of my
side projects, slack bots, etc in hopes of lowering the cost of hosting my side projects/keep
heroku from sleeping the apps I had hosted on their free plan.

At ShortStack, we occasionally do custom campaign builds for our clients as a design service. Some
of these required some additional functionality that we didn't provide at the time.  This guide
was created to show some of my colleagues how dokku works so we could consider it for hosting
design service applications in one place, without having to pay heroku for every app and database
we needed.
